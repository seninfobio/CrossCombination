  - Three types of Trangenic plants: Bt-transgenic B. napus crop plants, Bt-transgenic B. napus × B. rapa F1 hybrids, and first-generation backcrosses (B. rapa ×F1 hybrids)
  - Over 20 unique seed and 20 unique pollen parents were used to produce each of the three types
  - B. rapa served as seed parents for the F1 and BC populations of B. napus were all homozygous of Bt-GFP insertion. F1 plants are all hemizygous. 
  - The BC generation was expexted to consist of an equal mixture of hemizygotes and null homozygotes for the insertion
  - Transgenic B. napus (Wester) Btcry1AC gene
  - Every fourth day, all open flowers on all plants were hand pollinated-no natural polliantors in the Greenhouse
  - This study has assesed the impact of interspecific hybridization of weedy individuals which is flowered later and for longer periods were more likely to receive transgenic pollen transgeneic crops and F1 hybrids. wider stems are likely to receive transgenic pollens, transgene and maternal genes promoting late flowering time, long flowering periods, stem thickening, preferentially associated in the offspring of weedy mothers. weedy plants produced fewer seeds with the highest probability of hybridization. maternal weeds that flowered late and for long periods are less fit. Weedy plants are likely to alter phenological difference than transgenic palnts, altering the fitness of hybridizing weeds.

  -  The author has test the genetic load on B. rapa x B. napus allels that are unintentioally transferred with the transgene into the genome of the weed host. So test with interspecific and intraspecific competition environement to the assess the fitness of genetic load with Brassica species. on the other hand utilizing a transgenic mitigation strategy to reduce the numebr of frequency with transgeneic progeny under field condition, this would be a stronger mitigator of transgene perisitence than random transgene site mediated genetic load.

    - GFP B. napus field experiment as said above and taken after green house for seed ripening
    - evaluate F1 hybrids of B. rapa having GFP trait were species specific morphological traits

The hybridization rate between wild population of B. rapa and HR B. napus in field was higher and showed greater variability (0-53%) between plant to plant. The risk rate (7-8%) of hybridization was considered where B. rapa and B. napus presence the hybridization will occur. The B.rapa plants doesnot need large volumes of pollen from a B. napus canola pollen pressure are highly compatiable with self incompatible plants like B.rapa. The author has found B. rapa x B. napus F1 hybrids were reduced, though shows high level of fertility assessed through the pollen viability and able to backcross with B. rapa.

     - This study, have been investigated the gene flow of transgeneic B. napus to B. rapa, through all the varieties were exhibited differe levels of crossabilities. Perhaps, heading type of B. rapa shows higher crossibility index than non heading type. Noteably, outcrossing rate between B. rapa and B. napus has recorded lower than previous records (Scott and Wilkinson, 1998) under natural conditions. Though, glufosinate resistant hybrids shows lack of homozygous herbicide resistant lines due to lower transgeneic pollen was observed in the resistant lines. Altogether, transgenic plant allowed under the threshold measures.

The higher gene flow rate 3% was observed in spontaneous hybridization of B. napus x B. juncea than insect proof cage were frequently provided houseflies and honey bees. In low herbivory have not affect any gene flow rates rather than to stimulate Bt OSR were influenced with flower styles, pollen movement, which increased the gene flow rates. Furthermore, in mixed stands increase the female stands, which indicates in wild mustard had less pollen and more ovules than in pure stands.

  -  karyotyping, FISH, BAC-FISh showed transgene located either A or C genome also mixoploids.
  -  During the irregular progenies from cultivar, transgene located on C than A chromosome. 
  -  The survival fitness of the progenies indicates a lower gene flow risk, transgene located on C rather than A chromosome of B. napus.
  -  During self pollination of the BC generations with GM oilseed rape and wild B. juncea, the genetic processess is complex mitigated the gene flow through the breeding of transgenic allopolyploid crops due to transgenes is inserted into alien chromosomes.

  - B. napus cv. ‘Z7B10 (glufosinate-resistant line) x B. juncea (80 cultivars)
  - artificially emasculated 
  - F1 hybrid (female) x B. juncea parent (male)

  - To investigated gene flow from transgenic B. napus to B. juncea varieties, whereas the geneflow and intergrossion of both the speceies are limited. The various combination of parental lines between the species, F1 hybrids observed high crossibility and number of seed sets, although the frequencies may depends with different combinations. The natural F1 hybrids are more sterile use to backcross with B. juncea parents. Here, the natural outcrossing rates are lower than the threshold level. Hence, the recommended isolation distance of 100 m between B.napus and B. juncea to avoid transgene flow or it may reduce the frequencey of gene flow below the threshold level.

  - The herbicide selection F1 to F4 progeny of B. juncea x B. napus (glyphosate tolerant, RT73)) B. juncea x B. napus (glufosinate-tolerant, HCN28). 
  - The occurance of nature genetic processes during self pollination, backcross generations of transgeneic B. napus and wild B. juncea, the transgenes located on A or C chromosome were mixoploids. The progenies shows that, chromosome pairing of pollen mother cells are more irregular from the cultivar may transgene located on A chromosome.

  - Spontaneous hybridization frequency between B. juncea and B. napus (B. juncea x B. napus, mixed cultivation and isolated cultivation; Tsuda et al. (2012a), Heenan et al. (2007), Jørgensen et al. (1998), Huiming et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2010), Bing et al. (1991, 1996))
  - B. napus × B. juncea mixed cultivation (Heenan et al. (2007), Jørgensen et al. (1998), Bing et al. (1991, 1996))
